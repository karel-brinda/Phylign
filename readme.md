# MOF-search

This is the pipeline for BLAST-like search within the 661k collection.


## Dependencies

:warning: **`Mac OS X` users have to necessarily install `gcc-11` to run `mof-search`. The easiest way is through `brew`:**
```
brew install gcc@11
```



Some dependencies are packaged into `conda` environments that `snakemake` will automatically create.
Others are non-standard (which you might need to install) and standard (which you probably have).


### Non-standard
* `python >= 3.7`
* `snakemake >= 6.2.0`
* `mamba >= 0.20.0`

### Standard
* `bash`
* `make`
* `curl`
* `xz`
* `head`
* `grep`
* `awk`

## Walkthrough

This is our recommended steps to run `mof-search`:

1. Run `make test` to ensure the pipeline works for the sample queries and just 3 batches. This will also setup `COBS`;
2. Run `make download` to download all the assemblies and batches for the 661k;
3. Run `make clean` to clean the intermediate files from the previous run;
4. Add your desired queries to the `queries` directory and remove the sample ones;
5. Run `make` to run align your queries to the 661k.



## Commands

* `make`          Run everything
* `make test`     Run the queries on 3 batches, to test the pipeline completely
* `make download` Download the 661k assemblies and COBS indexes
* `make match`    Match queries using COBS (queries -> candidates)
* `make map`      Map candidates to the assemblies (candidates -> alignments)
* `make report`   Generate Snakemake report
* `make clean`    Clean intermediate search files
* `make cleanall` Clean all generated and downloaded file



## Directories

* `asms/`, `cobs/` Downloaded assemblies and COBS indexes
* `queries/` Queries, to be provided within one or more FASTA files (`.fa`)
* `intermediate/` Intermediate files
   * `00_cobs` Decompressed COBS indexes (tmp)
   * `01_match` COBS matches
   * `02_filter` Filtered candidates
   * `03_map` Minimap2 alignments
   * `fixed_queries` Sanitized queries
* `output/` Results



## Notes

### Non-`ACGT` bases

All non-`ACGT` bases in your queries are transformed into `A`.

### Query files

Try to keep the number of query files low or their name short.
If you have tens or hundreds or more query files, concatenate them all into one before running `mof-search.

### Query headers

For now, all query headers have to be unique among all query files.
